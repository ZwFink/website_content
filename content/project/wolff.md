title: "Using Low-Powered Wide-Area Networks as a Control Channel for Challenged Network Environments"
subtitle: ""
summary: "A digital divide exists in the United States, where some communities have limited access to the high-bandwidth networks that connect the world. By utilizing Low-Powered Wide-Area Networks, we can help to bridge this divide. Currently, we are working to utilize ultra low-powered, long-ranged network architectures designed for connecting IoT devices to create a heterogeneous, delay-tolerant network that connects those in resource-constrained communities to the rest of the internet."
