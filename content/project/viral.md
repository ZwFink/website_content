title: "Detection of Viral Exposure History Through Antiviral Antibody Response"
subtitle: ""
summary: "Viruses represent a diverse and ubiquitous challenge to the immune system, and a record of these encounters is preserved within our antibody responses. Understanding the diverse antiviral immune response has important implications for both epidemiology and immunology, but our capacity for characterizing this response has been historically limited due to the low throughput nature of the available assays. To circumvent this limitation, we have developed a highly multiplexed approach for serological characterization that allows for the elucidation of an individualâ€™s full viral exposure history within a single assay. By treating the design of the assay as an instance of the set-cover problem, we were able to achieve similar levels of epitope coverage in 37-54% fewer oligos than existing approaches. By introducing our probes to blood that has been exposed to these viruses, we hope to be able to elucidate an individual's viral exposure history at the species level."
